# Totum Design System

## Features

### Individual Component Imports

Each component is compartmentalised with it's own CSS module. Import only the components you use and cut down on excessive CSS and JS build files:

    import { ComponentName } from 'totum/ComponentName'

### Style using CSS Variables

Override default styles using the template CSS variable file. Additionally, inline CSS can be passed to some components for more granular styling.
